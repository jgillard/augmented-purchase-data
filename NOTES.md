# Dev Notes

## Introduction
This repository / codebase will likely be pretty messy as I work. This is my first REST API, first Go project, first time developing with TDD, so I'm making a lot of mistakes (not following best practices) along the way. But that means I'm learning a lot! Here I'll write notes of what I'm discovering en-route.

## Notes
* The process of: write failing test, make it pass, refactor, is valuable and you have to be disciplined to stick to that. Right now I'm not doing well at producing commits that only refactor, or only add new tests; I'm trying to move too quickly which results in test changes & code changes muddled together. Having a clearer idea of the exact task that will go into the next commit will help, rather than making general improvements, or working in multiple improvements at once.
